## Coding Standards

### JavaScript Style Guide

Follow these guidelines to maintain code consistency:

1. **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces (not tabs)
2. **Semicolons**: Always use semicolons
3. **Quotes**: Use double quotes for strings
4. **Naming**:
   - `camelCase` for variables and functions
   - `PascalCase` for classes and models
   - `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants
5. **Comments**: Use JSDoc format for function documentation

### JSDoc Example

```javascript
/**
 * Encrypts a password using AES-256-CBC encryption
 * @param {string} password - Plain text password to encrypt
 * @returns {{encryptedPassword: string, iv: string}} Encrypted data
 */
const encryptPassword = (password) => {
    // Implementation
};
```

### Code Quality

- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Keep functions small and focused
- Avoid deep nesting (max 3 levels)
- Handle errors appropriately
- Don't log sensitive information

### Security Guidelines

- Never hardcode secrets or API keys
- Always validate and sanitize user input
- Use prepared statements for database queries
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Document security considerations in code

## Commit Guidelines

### Commit Message Format

Use clear, descriptive commit messages following this format:

```

```
